            <p>Welcome to my portfolio.
                 I am thrilled you’ve come to visit my showcase of work that I’ve compiled over the years, which includes a combination of collaborations, commissioned work and personal projects. 
                Take a look and feel free to get in touch if you’d like to discuss potential opportunities to work together.</p>
